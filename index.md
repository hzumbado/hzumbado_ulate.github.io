I am a faculty at the [School of Biological Sciences](https://www.biologia.una.ac.cr/) since 2025. I am interested in quantifying how environmental threats (e.g., pathogens, invasive species, climate change, and habitat deterioration) drive the distribution of native species in different spatiotemporal scales. I am also interested in identifying the environmental factors (biotic and abiotic) that constrain, partially or totally, the negative effect of threats on endangered species. For this, I use a combination of spatial analyses, geographic information systems, and niche modeling.
